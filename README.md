# Template-Tracking
Imagine you are stuck in traffic. A bandit stole your precious dog and ran away in a Car! You are in shock but here is the thing, the surveillance camera tracked down the car and your dog was rescued!

It was all possible because of the Template tracking methods which helps detect objects across frames. The block based method is a point tracking method
and Lucas-Kanade method is a template tracking method.
